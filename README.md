A simple guide to responsive design.<br>

####Why bother with responsive?
We want our websites to be useable on all devices by responding to the user’s behavior, screen size and screen orientation.

####A Fragmented World
As of 2013, there are thousands of different devices and screen sizes that browse the internet, so it's impossible to design layouts to target them all. Instead, we must take a more fluid approach to design.

####Mobile First
The term “mobile first” gets thrown around a lot lately. What it really means is to start with mobile styles and layer on styles optimized for larger screens only as needed. In other words, your mobile styles become the default and you no longer have to override them later. It’s much simpler!

> By assuming a flexible but simple layout by default, you can better guard against browsers—with viewports wide and small—that aren’t quite capable of the full responsive layout. So when we’re talking about layout, “mobile first” really means “progressive enhancement.” — Ethan Marcotte
